<blockquote><p>Finding yourself stuck for hours at a time on code that just won&#8217;t work?</p>
<p>Feel like you have a clear picture of what you want in your head but having trouble getting started capturing it in code?</p></blockquote>
<p>The residents will be running a one-hour workshop on simple techniques to</p>
<ol>
<li>Break down your ideas into more code-able chunks</li>
<li>Track down problems in your code (debugging)</li>
<li>Prepare your code to ask for help</li>
</ol>
<p>We will walk through examples, build them, comment them and debug them together.</p>
<p>BYOBC (Bring your own broken code!) We&#8217;ll be working with <a href="https://github.com/itpresidents/Debug">code from here</a>. (We will be working with Processing, but techniques apply to all programming languages.)</p>
<p>The workshop will take place during the first hour of the Monday ICM Help Session to run this workshop.Â Monday Nov 12th 2-3PM, Conference Room</p>
