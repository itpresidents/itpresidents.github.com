> Feel like you have a clear picture of what you want in your head but having trouble getting started capturing it in code?

The residents will be running a one-hour workshop on simple techniques to

1.  Break down your ideas into more code-able chunks
2.  Track down problems in your code (debugging)
3.  Prepare your code to ask for help

We will walk through examples, build them, comment them and debug them together.

BYOBC (Bring your own broken code!) We’ll be working with [code from here][3]. (We will be working with Processing, but techniques apply to all programming languages.)

The workshop will take place during the first hour of the Monday ICM Help Session to run this workshop. Monday Nov 12th 2-3PM, Conference Room
