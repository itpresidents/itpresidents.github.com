It’s second semester and to celebrate I held another Git session. Here’s a few links for tutorials about getting started using Git.

First off, here’s roughly all of the content of the talk in written form: [Introduction to Git][1]

 [1]: http://skli.se/2012/09/22/introduction-to-git/

After you’ve read through that, check out [Git Workflow for Beginners][2] which is shorter than the previous article and more about how to use Git while working on a project. If the first article is about getting acquainted to Git, this is about putting Git to use.

And finally, [Git Reading list][3], some links to tutorials about advanced topics with Git as well as a few tools to make working with Git easier.
