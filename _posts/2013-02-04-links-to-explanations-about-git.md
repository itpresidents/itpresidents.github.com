<p>It&#8217;s second semester and to celebrate I held another Git session. Here&#8217;s a few links for tutorials about getting started using Git.</p>
<p>First off, here&#8217;s roughly all of the content of the talk in written form: <a target="_blank"  href="http://skli.se/2012/09/22/introduction-to-git/">Introduction to Git</a></p>
<p>After you&#8217;ve read through that, check out <a target="_blank" href="http://skli.se/2012/10/07/git-workflow-beginner/">Git Workflow for Beginners</a> which is shorter than the previous article and more about how to use Git while working on a project. If the first article is about getting acquainted to Git, this is about putting Git to use.</p>
<p>And finally, <a target="_blank" href="http://skli.se/2012/09/25/git-further-readings/">Git Reading list</a>, some links to tutorials about advanced topics with Git as well as a few tools to make working with Git easier.</p>
