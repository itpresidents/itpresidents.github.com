1.  What are polar coordinates and why should I care? 
    *   Anatomy of a circle. 
        *   What is PI and why is it awesome? 
            *   How to calculate the location of a point on a circle using sin() and cos()? [Revolving Dot][2] 
                *   What exactly is sin() and cos()?) | [See a Sine Wave being created by a circle live!][3] 
                    *   How to draw stuff in a circle. [The Easy Way][4] | [The Hard Way][5]  
                        Syntax we covered includes:
                        
                        *   sin() 
                            *   cos() 
                                *   radians() 
                                    *   degrees() 
                                        *   translate() 
                                            *   rotate() 
                                                *   pushMatrix() 
                                                    *   popMatrix() 
                                                        *   PI, TWO_PI
