<p>Here is a link to the two <a href="https://github.com/itpresidents/OF_imageProcessing_workshop">examples</a> we were worked on in the workshop this evening. My apologies to those who asked about screen recording, we didn&#8217;t end up making that work, but if anyone would like to go through these examples or have me walk through the slides, please come to office hours.</p>

<p>We briefly touched on using the<a href="https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv">ofxCV</a> add-on for OpenCV in OpenFrameworks. Here are <a href="https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv/wiki/Intermediate-Computer-Vision-with-openFrameworks">notes</a> from a presentation Kyle MacDonald gave at the EyeO festival about OpenCV, and is a great resource if you&#8217;re interested in learning more.</p>
