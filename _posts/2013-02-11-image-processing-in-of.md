Here is a link to the two [examples][1] we were worked on in the workshop this evening. My apologies to those who asked about screen recording, we didn’t end up making that work, but if anyone would like to go through these examples or have me walk through the slides, please come to office hours.

We briefly touched on using the[ofxCV][2] add-on for OpenCV in OpenFrameworks. Here are [notes][3] from a presentation Kyle MacDonald gave at the EyeO festival about OpenCV, and is a great resource if you’re interested in learning more.
