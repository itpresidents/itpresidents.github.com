A student asked me how to do recursions (on the first week of ICM!!).

I asked her to go through the first 3 Processing tutorials, make something more simple, and taught her some cool tricks. I forget just how ambitious ITP students can get. But then I kind of went on a tangent and instead of writing the Processing JS tutorial I promised, I made this sketch. It’s a good test to see how well the ProcessingJS plugin works, I guess. If you don’t see anything, even after a couple page refreshes, let me know.
